    "## Classes Background\n",
    "> All Classes FRQs relate well to POJOs in PBL.  The 2019 FRQ #2 describes a problem of a Step Tracker.  The task is to write a StepTracker class.   Included is the constructor and any required instance variables and\n",
    "methods.\n",
    "- Constructor: StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);\n",
    "- Get Methods with algorithms: tr.activeDays(); tr.averageSteps(); \n",
    "- Set Methods: tr.addDailySteps(9000);\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions to PBL this Project\n",
    "> This is a fun problem and could be expanded upon with PBL.  The StepTracker could be a POJO in Java. As a PBL concept, StepTracking is something that is done by an individual in relation to their personal fitness. What designs or objects would you need for StepTracking...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backend Assumptions:\n",
    "    - This problem has one-to-many relationship between \"Person\" object to \"Day\" objects.  \n",
    "    - Each \"Day\" is were the \"steps\" attribute would need to be kept.  \n",
    "    - Active days implies a \"Person\" object needs a \"goal_steps\" to be maintained against the \"steps\" for a \"Day\".\n",
    "    - Person Class. Contact and biographical information, like age/height/weight could be important to this application.  Such information could be used to help calculate goals steps.\n",
    "    - Day Class.  Steps is key element.  Perhaps application could include run or walking time.  Application could be extended to have things like calorie intake, sleep hours, mood ratio, or other factors that could help in determining goal versus accomplishments.\n",
    "    - Other Class(es).  A Day Class implies a Month or Year relationship.  Investigation should be made to determine best Java Modeling and Algorithms available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frontend Assumptions:\n",
    "    - A persons steps need to be recorded by a person in the Frontend\n",
    "    - A person would need to view or perform analytics on self, perhaps a daily step chart.\n",
    "    - A person might want to know about how they met or missed goals versus food calorie intake, hours slept, mood ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Project\n",
    "> To study Classes, which is the intent of FRQ2, A PBL project step tracking seems to begin with a \"Person\" Class.  This may be a deviation from FRQ 2 simplicity, but it is higher level way to think of this problem.\n",
