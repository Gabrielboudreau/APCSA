    "## Methods and Control Structures Background\n",
    "> All Web Endpoints are typically backed with Methods and Control Structures.  First, there are Methods that manage @RestController endpoint.  Additionally, there are the Methods and Control Structures that perform endpoint logic, like fetch data through the JPA.  In the 2019 FRQ1 they seem to limit OOP usage in favor of static methods.  The implementation below shows these methods as Class methods, not as methods of an object.\n",
    "- These methods could be endpoints of an API.\n",
    "- API would need to @RequestParam\n",
    "- API would return a @ResponseEntity"
