## Trimester 2 Pre-Holiday Units #1-#10 Objectives
> Units 1-10 mastery.  This period will complete formal teaching and grading on the basics of the 10 units.
- All student complete Teaching requirement.
- Students will demonstrate Fastpages, Jupyter Notebooks: java and javascript kernels working on their machine.
- During Pre-Holiday students will be expected to complete Fastpages/Blog with Homework assignments on Units #1-#10.
    - Every individual considers Fastpages tagging and searching on their blog.
    - Every student consider using Blog for both Study and PBL reference.
    - Revisions are encouraged after grading, these revision can be presented to Teacher on final grading.
- Grading of Units #1-#10
    - Comments will be enabled on each Unit within Student Blogs.
    - Grader will comment and score on user FastPage
    - Each pair will score the entirety of Project based on grader calculations.
    - Crossover Pair from Crossover Team, will evaluate grading for accuracy completeness.

## Trimester 2 Pre-Holiday Project Team formation
> Here is a list of Java BE required features.  Students are allowed to select their own FE features and application purpose.
- Spring Security and JWT
- Uploads of Content (ie Images, Spreadsheets, etc)
- Usage of a Database (ie SQLite)
- There are exploration possibilities into AWS using RDS instead of SQLite

### List of tech terms required to show year-to-date competency
> A big emphasis on learning units is learning vocabulary.  Incorporate all of these terms into your units of study.  Don't just have a list of definitions.  It is best if vocabulary is incorporated with working code, ie Jupyter Notebooks.

* Casting, specifically for Truncating or Rounding
* Wrapper Classes, why wrap int, double. Show examples
* Concatenation, explain or illustrate rules on mixed type Concatenation
* Math class, specifically Random usage
* Compound Boolean Expression
* Truth Tables
* De Morgan's Law
* Comparing Numbers
* Comparing Strings
* Comparing Objects
* for loop, enhanced for loop
* while loop versus do while loop
* nested loops
* Creating a Class, describe Naming Conventions
* Constructor, describe why there is no return
* Accessor methods, relationship to getter
* Mutator methods, relationship to setter, describe void return type
* Static variables, Class variables, show use case in code
* Show use case of access modifiers: Public, Private, Protected
* Static methods, Class methods
* this Keyword
* main method, tester methods
* Inheritance, extends
* Subclass constructor, super Keyword
* Overloading a method, same name different parameters
* Overriding a method, same signature of a method
