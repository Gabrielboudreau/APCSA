## Spring Security using Java Web Tokens Competition
- [JWT Hello Articles](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-jwt)

### JWT concepts via ChatGPT
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a popular way to authenticate users in a web application. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).
Here is an example of how you might use JWT for authentication in a JavaScript application:
1. The client sends a login request to the server with the user's credentials (e.g., username and password).
2. If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.
3. The client stores the JWT in a cookie or in local storage.
4. For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header.
5. The server verifies the JWT and, if it is valid, allows the request to proceed.

#### Authorization header example
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

The JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which specifies the algorithm used to sign the JWT (e.g., HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.

It is important to use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs to ensure that the JWT is not intercepted by an attacker. It is also a good idea to use short-lived JWTs (e.g., with an expiration time of one hour) and to refresh them frequently to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

#### Storing JWT
There are a few different options for storing a JWT in a JavaScript application:
1. Cookies: You can store the JWT in a cookie and send it back to the server with each request. This is a simple and widely-supported option, but it has some limitations. For example, you can't access cookies from JavaScript on a different domain, and some users may have cookies disabled in their browser settings.
2. Local storage: You can store the JWT in the browser's local storage (localStorage) or session storage (sessionStorage). This option allows you to access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, but it is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into your application and steal the JWT from the storage.
3. HttpOnly cookie: You can store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie, which is a cookie that can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side JavaScript. This option provides some protection against XSS attacks, but it is still vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

It is generally recommended to use a combination of options to provide the best security for your application. For example, you could store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie and also in local storage, and use JavaScript to send the JWT from local storage to the server with each request. This way, you can still access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, while also protecting against XSS attacks


#### Obtain JWT in a JavaScript application:
// Send a login request to the server with the user's credentials
const loginResponse = await fetch('/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: 'user1', password: 'pass123' }),
});

// If the login was successful, the server will return a JWT
if (loginResponse.ok) {
  // Extract the JWT from the response
  const jwt = loginResponse.headers.get('Authorization').split(' ')[1];

  // Store the JWT in a cookie or in local storage
  document.cookie = `jwt=${jwt}`;
  // or
  localStorage.setItem('jwt', jwt);
}

#### Authenticate with JWT in a JavaScript application:
This example sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with the user's credentials in the request body. If the login was successful, the server will return a 200 OK response with the JWT in the Authorization header. The JWT is then extracted from the header and stored in a cookie or in local storage.

You can then use the JWT for authentication in subsequent requests by sending it in the Authorization header:

// Send a request to a protected endpoint
const response = await fetch('/protected', {
  headers: {
    // Send the JWT in the Authorization header
    Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('jwt')}`,
  },
});

// If the JWT is valid, the server will allow the request to proceed
if (response.ok) {
  // ...
}

Keep in mind that this is just a simple example, and you should consider using a library like axios or fetch-intercept to handle the details of sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses. You should also consider using HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server, and use short-lived JWTs with frequent refresh to reduce the risk of unauthorized access
